# Replay Orchestrator Launcher

Downloads the replay-orchestrator bundle scripts and executes them.

Note that puppeteer must be installed locally in node_modules for the script to work, since although the puppeteer js code is bundled in the replay-orchestrator bundle script the install task for puppeteer downloads the required Chromium version.
